![Lysis](https://github.com/momenttech/lysis/raw/master/documentation/lysis-logo.svg)

## Overview

Lysis is a tool to generate files from JSON LD documentation, for example TypeScript classes, from backend.


It works well with [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/).

Take a look to the [Lysis documentation](https://momenttech.github.io/lysis/) for further details.

## Todo

- add documentation to lysis-tester
- write tests
- `lysis create-generator <generator name>` to scaffold a new generator
